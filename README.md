👋 Hi there! I'm Loukas Papalazarou, a dedicated and ambitious data enthusiast with a passion for turning raw information into valuable insights. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in [Data Science at The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&edition=2023&id=902), with a focus on honing my expertise in Machine Learning.

🎓 My educational journey started at the University of Cyprus, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a GPA of 8.32/10. During my time there, I delved into a diverse range of courses, from Object Oriented Programming and Databases to Machine Learning and Algorithm Complexity. My dedication was recognized when I received a perfect grade of 10/10 for my thesis on 'Implementation and Experimental Evaluation of a Byzantine-Tolerant Distributed Ledger System.'

🌍 My quest for knowledge took me abroad to the University of Hradec Kralove in the Czech Republic as part of the Erasmus program. There, I expanded my horizons with courses in areas like Computer Networks, Data Protection, and Python Programming Language.

💼 On the professional front, I've gained hands-on experience in the tech world through various roles. As a Software Engineering Intern at Algolysis Ltd, I developed a mobile app using Flutter that harnessed existing ML models for real-time part recognition. My time at CognitiveUX allowed me to contribute to a biometric wallet app and a Windows application using React Native and C# respectively.

🚀 Additionally, I'm the co-founder of HPF, a start-up aimed at improving the quality of life for individuals dealing with pain, particularly those in the terminal stages of cancer. This initiative has taken me to international platforms, including participation in the Stage Two start-up competition in Berlin.

🛠️ My toolkit includes a variety of programming languages such as Python, GO, C++, and Java. I'm well-versed in technologies like Docker, Git, React Native, and Kubernetes, and have hands-on experience with databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, and MongoDB. With a strong foundation in both software development and data science, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and creating innovative solutions.

🏆 On the side, I've achieved certifications in Google Cloud, enhancing my knowledge of core infrastructure and generative AI. I also hold a 1st Dan in Judo from the Cyprus Judo Federation, showcasing my commitment to personal growth beyond the digital realm.

🌐 Fluent in Greek and English, I believe in the power of effective communication to bridge the gap between complex concepts and real-world impact.
